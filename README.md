Internship at EXPOSYS DATA LABS - June 2023 to July 2023

During my 1-month internship at EXPOSYS DATA LABS in the field of data science, I focused on learning various machine learning algorithms. A significant part of my learning involved practical application through a small project on customer segmentation using K-means clustering.

Key Activities and Achievements:

Learning Machine Learning Algorithms: I gained practical knowledge in machine learning algorithms, including but not limited to K-means clustering, which is essential for unsupervised learning tasks like customer segmentation.

Project on Customer Segmentation: I successfully completed a project where I applied K-means clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing behaviors or demographic information. This project involved:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Algorithm Implementation: Applying K-means clustering to group customers into distinct segments based on similarities in their features.
Interpreting Results: Analyzing and interpreting the clusters generated to derive actionable insights for marketing or business strategy.


Skills Developed:

Data Handling: Improved skills in data collection, cleaning, and preparation.
Machine Learning Implementation: Hands-on experience in implementing machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems.
Project Management: Successfully managing a project from inception to completion within a limited timeframe.
Collaboration and Communication: Engaged in regular discussions with mentors and team members to receive guidance, share progress, and refine project goals.
